# Image-Downloader
Download Image From URLs or any web pages
This java application works on MacOS, Windows, Linux. It helps you download images from any web pages. Currently, it supports downloading images with normal URL (begins with http/https only.). I'm working on other URL format.

##How To Download
Simply paste the URL of the pages you want to download in the text area box. Make sure you select a destination to download first.
